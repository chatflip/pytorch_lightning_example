# YAML Formatting with Prettier

After editing any YAML file, you MUST validate formatting with Prettier.

## Instructions

1. Run Prettier via pre-commit:
   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit run prettier --all-files
   ```

2. If Prettier modifies files or reports errors:
   - Review the changes or error messages
   - Fix any issues in the YAML files
   - Re-run the command

3. Repeat until the command exits with code 0 (success)

## Important

- NEVER consider the task complete until Prettier passes
- Prettier may auto-format files; always verify the final state
